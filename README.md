# Joy of Painting Web Converter

A web-based tool for converting images to and from the .paint format used by the "Joy of Painting" Minecraft mod.  
Available by [zachup100.github.io/JoyOfPainting](https://zachup100.github.io/JoyOfPainting/)  

## Features

- **Import/Export**: Convert between .paint files and standard image formats (PNG, JPG)
- **Canvas Types**: Support for Small (16x16), Large (32x32), Long (32x16), Tall (16x32), and Extra Large (64x64) canvases
- **NBT Editing**: Edit painting metadata (title, author, name, generation, version) directly in the browser
- **Multi-Canvas Support**: Split large images across multiple canvases for higher resolution artwork with visual grid preview
- **Preview**: Real-time preview of conversions with painting information
- **Clipboard Support**: Paste images directly with Ctrl+V
- **Static Hosting**: Runs entirely in the browser - perfect for GitHub Pages

## Usage

### Converting .paint to Image

1. Drag and drop or select a .paint file
2. Choose output format (PNG or JPG)
3. Select desired image size (native or scaled)
4. Click "Convert" and choose a folder to save the image into

### Converting Image to .paint

1. Drag and drop, paste (Ctrl+V), or select an image file
2. Choose canvas type that matches your desired aspect ratio
3. Fill in painting metadata (title, author) - both required together or leave both empty
4. Select ".paint File" as output format
5. Click "Convert" and choose a folder to save the .paint file into

### Multi-Canvas Conversion

For creating high-resolution artwork:

1. Upload a large image
2. Select canvas type and adjust grid dimensions
3. Preview shows actual image sections for each canvas
4. Choose output format (.paint File, PNG Image, or JPG Image)
5. Click "Generate Multi-Canvas" and choose a folder to save all the section files into

### NBT Field Editing

The tool allows editing of these .paint file fields:
- **Title**: Display name of the painting (optional - leave empty for in-game editing)
- **Author**: Creator's name (optional - leave empty for in-game editing)
- **Name**: Internal UUID_timestamp identifier (auto-generated if empty)
- **Generation**: Canvas generation number (use 0 for in-game editable paintings)
- **Version**: Canvas version number (use 99 for in-game editable paintings)

**For in-game editable paintings**: Set Generation=0, Version=99, and leave Title/Author empty. This creates paintings that can be edited directly in Minecraft using the Joy of Painting mod interface.

**Important**: Title and Author must both be filled or both be empty - the mod requires both fields together for signed canvases.

## Technical Details

### File Format Support

- **Input**: .paint files (NBT format), PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, clipboard images
- **Output**: .paint files, PNG, JPG

### Canvas Types

| Type | Dimensions | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| Small | 16x16 | Icons, simple art |
| Large | 32x32 | Detailed square art |
| Long | 32x16 | Landscape/banner art |
| Tall | 16x32 | Portrait/vertical art |
| Extra Large | 64x64 | Highest detail square art |

### NBT Structure

The .paint files use Minecraft's NBT format with this structure:
```
{
  "generation": <0 for editable, 1 for locked>,
  "ct": <canvas_type>,
  "pixels": [<pixel_array>],
  "v": <99 for editable, 2 for locked>,
  "author": "<author_name>", // optional - only if title also present
  "name": "<uuid>_<timestamp>",
  "title": "<painting_title>" // optional - only if author also present
}
```

**Note**: Author and title fields are only included in the NBT if both have values. Empty fields are omitted to allow in-game editing.

2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Select source as "Deploy from a branch" → main branch
4. Your converter will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

### Local Development

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No build process required.

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

Requires support for:
- File API
- Canvas API
- ArrayBuffer
- TextEncoder/TextDecoder
- Clipboard API (for paste functionality)
- File System Access API (for the folder save prompt; browsers without it fall back to individual downloads)

## Limitations

- Maximum file size depends on browser memory limits
- The folder save prompt requires a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge); other browsers fall back to individual file downloads, which may trigger popup blockers for multi-canvas exports
- NBT parsing is implemented in JavaScript (may be slower than native Python)
